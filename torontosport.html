    <h1>Toronto Sports</h1>

    <!--note that I used 'em', stands for emphasis. Like strong/b, 'em' replaced 'i', but 'i' still works to italicize-->
    <h3><em>A Legacy of Excellence</em></h3>

    Toronto has teams for a large number of professional sports:

    <ul>
        <li>NHL</li>
        <li>MLB</li>
        <li>NBA</li>
        <li>NLL</li>
    </ul>

    <!--I've contained the image below in a div, because if I didn't, the text below would wrap around it-->
    <!--We call a div a 'blocking' element, because it "blocks out" the full width of the page, i.e. no wrapping-->
    <!--I could have also used a 'p' tag, which also blocks, but if I used a 'span' for example, the content would wrap-->
    <!--We'll see how we can control all this with CSS anyway-->

    <div>
        <!--I downloaded the image and put it in a subfolder called 'images' beside this file-->
        <img src="images/toronto.jpg" />
    </div>
